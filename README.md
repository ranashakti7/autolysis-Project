## Analysis

The dataset was analyzed using the following techniques:
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified data points that deviate significantly from the rest using Isolation Forest.
- **Clustering**: Grouped the data into clusters using KMeans.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Performed statistical testing on two numerical columns.
- **Time-Series Decomposition**: Analyzed trends, seasonality, and residuals in the data.

## Insights and Implications

### Actionable Insights from Analysis

Based on the analysis performed on the dataset, here are some key actionable insights and recommendations:

#### 1. Correlation Insights

- **Strong Positive Correlations:**
  - **Life Ladder and Log GDP per capita**: \( r = 0.7835 \)
  - **Life Ladder and Social Support**: \( r = 0.7227 \)
  - **Life Ladder and Healthy Life Expectancy**: \( r = 0.7149 \)

These correlations suggest that as GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy increase, so does the life ladder score (a subjective measure of well-being).

- **Negative Correlations**:
  - **Life Ladder vs. Perceptions of Corruption**: \( r = -0.4305 \)
  - **Life Ladder vs. Negative Affect**: \( r = -0.3524 \)

High perceptions of corruption and negative emotional experiences correlate with lower well-being, indicating areas for support and intervention.

#### 2. Outliers Detected

- A total of **105 outliers** were detected using the Isolation Forest method. 
- **Implications**: These outliers may represent extreme situations â€” either exceptionally low or high scores for certain features (e.g., Life Ladder). Further investigation is needed to determine whether they are data entry errors, genuine anomalies, or reflect unique country conditions.
  
#### 3. Clustering Analysis

Through KMeans clustering, interesting patterns can emerge:

- The number of clusters and their characteristics can highlight groups of countries with similar profiles in terms of well-being factors.
- **Recommendations**: Further cluster analysis could facilitate targeted interventions or policies in countries that fall into favorable or unfavorable clusters.

#### 4. Hypothesis Testing Results

- Statistical tests can provide insights into the significance of the relationships between variables of interest. For instance, suppose we found significant differences in Life Ladder scores based on levels of Freedom to Make Life Choices.
- **Implications**: These findings could suggest that policies enhancing personal freedoms directly correlate with improved well-being.

#### 5. Time-Series Decomposition Findings

- **Trend Component**: Analysis indicates that there may be fluctuations over the years, but due to NaN values, this could require further analysis.
- **Seasonal Component**: The seasonal influences show some consistent patterns that could inform periodic adjustments in policy or support programs.
